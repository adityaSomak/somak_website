# Biography

I am currently pursuing PhD in Computer Science in [CIDSE, Arizona State University](http://cidse.engineering.asu.edu/). I am working on Image Understanding using a combination of Deep Learning, Commonsense Reasoning and Knowledge Representation Techniques under the supervision of [Prof. Chitta Baral](http://www.public.asu.edu/~cbaral/). I am also being jointly mentored by [Dr. Yezhou Yang](http://yezhouyang.engineering.asu.edu/) (Assistant Professor, ASU). 
 
I have completed my Masters (ME) in Computer Science from the [Department of CSA in Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore](http://www.csa.iisc.ernet.in/) in 2011 with a concentration in Machine Learning under the supervision of [Prof. M Narasimha Murty](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VQZTmpcAAAAJ&hl=en) (author of Data Clustering: A Review which has close to 10000 citations). I have done my Bachelors in CS from Jadavpur University in 2009. After a brief stint at Yahoo, I joined Strand Life Sciences where I worked in the NGS team for nearly two and half years before joining ASU to pursue PhD.
